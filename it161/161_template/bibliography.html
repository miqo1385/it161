                                    <p>Its themes are manifold, and it revolves around an elusive German author and the unsolved and ongoing</p>
                                    <p> murders of women in Santa Teresa, a violent city inspired by Ciudad Juárez and its epidemic of female homicides.</p>

                                    <p>journalism, and the breakdown of relationships and careers. 2666 explores 20th-century degeneration through</p>
